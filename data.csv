""Traditional"" accounting methods and reports were developed during the Great Depression to describe the ""value"" of a business to an outsider - they were never meant to help anyone run a business. To this day, many businesses both Large and Small continue to rely on outsiders to look after their accounts.

Even the most ""modern"" products out there STILL use this outdated approach - worse still, they are hugely complex as they try to cater for BOTH Large Corporations with thousands of employees and massive stockpiles of Inventory, and Sole Traders alike...

eLEDGER was designed from the ground up, specifically to help YOU run your SMALL business, without needing any outsider to tell you how much they think it's worth. No complex menus to navigate and forms to fill out, using terminology you barely understand. eLEDGER just gives you what you need - and nothing else...

The system that became the basis for InvariVison, emerged as a side-product of technology built for autonomous robot navigation technology. The creator of AVM (Associative Video Memory) video search algorithm, Dmitriy Yeremeyev, realized that this side-product can be successfully applied in reverse video search of video databases. 

InvariVision company was established in 2013 when Dmitry was joined by Maksim Kamensky, a software developer and a producer of successful PC video games, and by Aleksandr Krisak, an expert in UNIX-systems. In 2014, the technology was further developed and now could be applied in monitoring video advertisements on Internet and Television. 

In 2016, the InvariVision team took part in EECVC 2016 Conference with paper topic ‚ÄúApplying Image Matching Algorithms to Video Recognition and Autonomous Robot Navigation‚Äù. In the same year, the team won the third place in the Best Start-Up Contest conducted by CRDF Global.

the utmost care of each one throughout the entire process.
We call it three-dimensional problem-solving.

Warranty Ninja,,,,Unknown,,http://www.warranty.ninja,0,0,,Internet,https://www.linkedin.com/company/warranty-ninja,"Warranty Ninja simplifies and enhances the consumer product registration process for both businesses and their customers.

In 2014, Americans purchased $419 billion dollars worth of consumer products and most of those products came with an invitation to register their purchases. Consumer products companies rely on that registration to learn about their customers and better target their marketing. In fact, many companies offer incentives, such as extended warranties, to encourage product registration because it‚Äôs so important to their marketing efforts. Nonetheless, the majority of consumers still do not register their purchases. That‚Äôs where we come in.

Product registration is a real problem for consumer product companies. Generally, the company relies on the consumer to manually fill out a physical card, which is then mailed in, and which must then be manually entered by an employee. The process is inefficient and it‚Äôs a waste of resources and human capital. The current process is not very good for the consumer either. Due to the current outdated and inefficient methods, less than 10% of all products are ever registered.

Warranty Ninja changes the game.

Businesses who sign up with us enter their products into our system. Instead of a traditional paper card, their consumers will receive a unique code and an invitation to join the Warranty Ninja platform for free - either on the web or through our app. Consumers will fill out their personal information on our platform just one time, and then will easily be able to register their products by scanning that special code.

Our product will increase the rate of registration by making the process easier, so not only will we provide previously untapped market information, we will increase the amount of information they have access to.",Partnership,,2-10 employees,,0,,,,"Mobile,",B2B

We're engineers, doctors, artists, parents and leaders. But most importantly, we're people who care deeply about the social impact of our work.

Permission-First Marketing Philosophy

Every marketing activity is performed with three important values in mind: Congruence, Permission and Transparency.

Congruence: Congruence is about consistency. Marketing with congruence ensures your brand awareness, lead generation and customer nurturing campaigns are tailored specifically to your brand‚Äôs voice, image and target audience(s).

Permission: Unlike interruption marketing, we aim to foster caring, long-term relationships with prospective customers and clients who give us permission to market to them whilst helping them overcome key objections.

Transparency: Being transparent gives us confidence to manage and execute effective marketing campaigns whilst managing expectations on both sides. Without transparency, there is no trust - but with it, problems get solved, ideas are generated and people do their best work.

Whilst we do employ many, fast-growth marketing strategies, we always put the end-user first. And take a permission-first approach to all our activities.",Public Company,,2-10 employees,"Inbound Marketing, Search Engine Optimisation, Product Marketing, and Conversational Marketing",0,"New Relic, Next.js, LinkedIn Ads",,,"Marketing, ,",B2B B2C

About the Team

Jibility was created by a team of business and IT consultants based in Australia. Following careers that spanned the UK, USA, Australia, Germany and more, the team began to wonder if there was an easier way for companies to tackle one of the most common challenges: bridging that gap between strategic vision and successful execution. 

We couldn't find a simple software solution that fitted the bill, so we decided to create it ourselves. Combining a flair for entrepreneurship with our global business expertise, we launched Jibility in 2018.

SkillSnap replaces CVs with holistic and interactive applicant profiles, thereby reducing the guesswork of identifying applicants who present a strong fit. 

Why Use SkillSnap?
Because each year companies waste time and money trying to identify the right applicants as a result of using archaic recruitment techniques and platforms. SkillSnap solves this problem by giving businesses a user-friendly dashboard full of value-added features which in turn allow recruiters and hiring managers to quickly identify suitable candidates. If they hire someone who is not only a good fit because of technical skills but also a good fit culturally, then hiring managers and recruiters should see less staff turnover. Of course we cannot guarantee cultural fit nor would using SkillSnap completely obviate turnover. SkillSnap is designed to make the hiring process easier by taking a lot of the guesswork out of the equation.

With our patented technology platform we can radically push the current accuracy level of on-body movement detection to an unprecedented level.

Our platform largely outperforms all currently available motion caption capabilities:

- capturing explosive kinetics with unprecedented accuracy 

- capture such minute displacements as the onset and development of muscle tremble e.g. caused by fatigue (standing too long) or by excessive effort (climbing flights of stairs).

- mapping kinetics @ medical data quality level, allowing to compare strategic moves in detail (such as bowling - cricket, smashing - volleyball etc) i.e. This is due to our direct measurement concept producing unequivocal medical quality measurement data.

- The direct measurements have an other major advantage: displacement is measured with hyper accuracy and resolution, hence all derivatives (speed, acceleration and jerk) are equally of supreme accuracy.

The way your potential and current customers receive information has changed: They are active seekers, not passive receivers. The media has never been more complicated - online, offline, social and broadcast. For small and medium-sized businesses this complexity may seem confusing, but it can mean greater opportunity. More media = greater demand for newsworthy stories.

Thanks to the Internet, today‚Äôs news is also tomorrow‚Äôs news, and the next day‚Äôs. It exists online for the duration. 

Stories on genuine news sites also rank highly on Google and as more people search for news and information, positive news stories about your business can create a lasting impression, over and over again.

In short, news coverage can be your secret SEO weapon.

Accord PR takes a multi-channel approach, using online and social media channels as well as traditional magazines and newspapers.

We work with small to medium sized, owner managed businesses, often in a business-to-business market. We help those businesses create a widespread reputation that builds trust to ultimately boost business.

We‚Äôre calling BS on databases and AI/‚Äùmachine learning‚Äù lead generation software. The information is expensive and out-of-date. Usually, SDRs still have to clean up that data and then go prospect deeper because in today‚Äôs world buyers live online. Having their name, company, email and title doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore to get attention or replies.

What does work are real plays from a playbook, like using a high/low strategy or getting creative with highly personalized emails or video, maybe combined with some direct mail. However, SDRs are still stuck cleaning up data and doing manual tasks, wasting 15-17 hours/week, while the company is losing $30/rep/hour. Super inefficient.

Online shopping is undeniably lacking the in-store experience - and shoppers are noticing; 50% say they could be better engaged by retailers online. We're aware that shoppers are bored of browsing through countless flat, relatively undifferentiated, pages online, where it is just click and move on. In fact, 48% of a retailer's existing customers would seek out their website more often if its interactivity increased.

Our solution is a mechanism to increase user engagement, as retailers can promote their products, in a more appealing and interactive manner without the promotional noise. At the same time, we employ physical retailers extensive knowledge of product positioning and store layout to maximise conversions and cross-selling. 

Our platform has already attracted interest from the country‚Äôs top retailers, evident by the 100 retailers onboard our BETA site, which saw over 50,000 users through our ‚ÄòVirtual Doors‚Äô. Throughout and following our BETA, we attracted extensive national media attention - including Channel 9‚Äôs A Current Affair, Channel 7 News, the BRW, Today Tonight, as well as many other publications and broadcasts.

Through international business partnerships, we cut down the time to go-to-market and help businesses acquire new customers.  

Though, expanding into foreign countries sounds simple, the reality is that companies will face cultural, legal and logistical barriers for entry.  For example, something routine as flying to a city, renting a car and driving it to a customer site can be a logistical nightmare in India, where the best option would be is to rent a car with a driver, who will drive you to the customer and stay with you until the end of your day.  Despite these hurdles, countries like India and China offer markets that are massive, still in their infancy and full of business ideas that are yet to materialize.  Therefore, we encourage companies expand into these countries to stay ahead of their competition.  To aid expansion, we offer Business Setup, Legal Counsel, Accounting, HR and IT infrastructure services.  These services will quickly give businesses a foot hold in their new country. 

In addition to our basic services, we feel that basic IT infrastructure setups such as a website and tracking customer behaviour are essential to start-ups.  To support these fundamental needs, we provide cloud storage and business analytics services.  When you sign up with us, you receive 10 GB of cloud storage and basic access to our Business Analytics platform for free.

Ultracapacitors (UCs), also known by name of Supercapacitors or Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC), represent a family of energy storage devices demonstrating extremely high specific power characteristics which outperform any known type of batteries, such as lead-acid, Li-ion, NiMH etc. In the same time, they can store quite high values of specific energy, greater than conventional capacitors.
   
UCs can be used as a stand-alone system or in a combination with batteries. In the latter case, UCs substantially increase the battery efficiency and operation life. 

Some of the main market applications for UCs include:

-	Transport (kinetic energy recuperation systems and start-stop systems in hybrid vehicles); 
-	Industry (cranes, forklifts, welding machines);
-	Energy Supply and Alternative Energy (power grids, UPS, wind-mills etc);
-	Consumer electronics (hand tools, flash lights etc). 

Presently, YUNASKO ultracapacitors possess world-best specific characteristics in terms of power and energy, leaving far behind its closest competitors.  At this point, YUNASKO is working hard towards increasing its production capabilities and entering the global market of UCs in 2012-2013.",Privately Held,,51-200 employees,R&D in the field of ultracapacitors and Ultracapacitors production and commercialization,0,YouTube,,,"Manufacturing, Electronics, Energy Efficiency, Energy, Battery, , Energy Storage",B2B

But how the heck can we ""live""‚Äã that in our daily lives as self-employed professionals or service companies?

I have asked myself this question for a very long time. When I started my first own business I had no idea where to start with marketing and sales. So many how-to videos out there. One gazillion online courses promising gold nuggets in just a few weeks.

Pah. I have tried all that and at the end I had no one to ask because those online courses show the ideal world very often. But my case was unique and I had questions which I did not find an answer for.

At the bottom line I was frustrated, had made only little sales and had no idea where to start to get a structure into my sales pipeline to be honest.

After working for nearly two years with a marketing and sales trainer who taught me how to install a system to my sales pipeline things became more clear. Easier and with less stress.

Besides that my own sales took off I was able to help friends at our local public speaking club with their business. I gave one friend some tips. Then another one. And soon they started referring paying clients to me. And this way I found my true passion which is the foundation of expertresults.co:

Empathising with prospects. Putting the prospect in the centre of all we do because this leads ultimately to filled sales pipelines for your service business to make the world a little better. Starting with one client at a time and being scalable in the long run.

One of our recent workshop participants nailed it with this description of what we teach and live today:

""Andreas showed us frameworks to achieve repeatable success.""‚Äã

The control of hemorrhage is a critical step in first aid, trauma care and surgery, unfortunately, the materials and methods available to stop bleeding in pre-hospital care have not changed or improved greatly over the years. 
Liquid fibrin sealants, also known as Biological Glue,  have been used as an operating room adjunct to mild hemorrhage control. Fibrin Sealants (FS) have also been used clinically, not only for hemorrhage control but also in various surgical situations. It became clear that liquid FS is not effective in severe bleeding and is not effective in sealing of leakage under high pressure situation. In these cases surgeons use a combination of methods including suture, synthetic glues, bandages etc. 
Currently there is no approved product which can be used to control severe bleeding and treat leakage of tissues during and after surgery.

EMPLOYFY,,Oakleigh,Victoria,Australia,"Melbourne, Oakleigh",http://employfy.com,3,122,2014,Information Technology and Services,https://www.linkedin.com/company/employfy,"Employfy is a Hat Partner business. 

Employfy‚Äôs aim is to be a strategic partner to businesses in developing countries in fulfilling their human resource needs. Human resources is by far the greatest asset for these countries, it is in abundance but often not with the right skills for the opportunities on offer. The management of companies are often constrained in making the right people selections at the right time to enhance productive capacity. 

One particular problem is the disproportionate number of job applicants for each job advertised. This causes hiring managers to spend an inordinate amount of time processing applications. Employfy responded to this need, explored and built a technology solution that will aid the applicant processing, tracking and decision making process. As a result, and as a first step, Employfy has provided a unique platform that employers can use to quickly test, filter, discuss and select candidates in a collaborative environment. The platform seeks to professionalise the engagement between employers and job seekers and help elevate the recruitment process in all targeted countries. 

As a result, employers:-

1. Gain time and cost efficiencies, and a tested pool of applicants
2. Build a ‚Äòbench‚Äô of good, tested talent for future needs
3. Ensure engagement of various stakeholders to help make a hiring decision

For job seekers, they get to:

1. Be tested on their skills which is a learning outcome for them
2. Participate in interviews at the least cost possible - via video     recording

Twice a year, 7 new startups are accelerated by SU42 during a 4-month program. These startups are selected for their skills, their cohesion, their mindset, their vision of the market, their fit with the market and, eventually, their startup idea. To be able to apply for Startup42, there needs to be at least one founder in charge of coding the first version of the product.

During the acceleration the startups find some help to: go from a good idea to a minimum viable product, validate their initial market hypothesis, and present their product to the world. These goals are achieved through the following services:

1.		Serendipity mentorship from entrepreneurs 

2.		Workshops with experts from specific industry fields
 
3.		Meetings with investors 

4.		A co(mmunity) working space within the EPITA campus during the program

5.		800k‚Ç¨ in perks from our partners 

The 4 months end with the SU42 Demo Day: a pitching session in front of the startup ecosystem where the 7 startups have to show a functional demo of their product.

This program is best designed for teams starting a startup with a technological edge and having more trouble with the business side than the technical side. We do not want any beautiful tech innovation to die in the wild because they did not get sufficient help. 

And to firmly ensure that, we built a model that is fair and with as little barrier as possible: the 4 months are free of any charges and we expect our alumni to make a donation when they feel it‚Äôs the moment to do so.

Everline‚Äôs fully automated smart lending platform cuts through old-fashioned underwriting practices by linking directly to thousands of business data points, such as Cloud based accounting services, eBay accounts, tax reports and bank statements, to make fast and fair lending decisions based on how a business is performing right now.  

Because the technology does all the legwork, the application process only takes around 10 minutes to complete for new customers and lending decisions are usually made within one hour of an application being submitted. If approved, the working capital funds are then paid into the businesses bank account within minutes.

Limited companies, limited liability partnerships, partnerships and sole traders can access ¬£3,000 - ¬£120,000 of working capital for up to 24 months. The typical annual cost of a loan is 16%-24% depending on an individual risk profile and there are no fees for re-paying early. Interest is only ever charged on the outstanding loan amount and for as long as the money is borrowed.

Everline and ezbob are the first business e-lenders to be provided with a multi-million pound loan guarantee agreement by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The UK government supported Angel Co-Fund is also an investor and the company recently became Oaktree Capital Management L.P.‚Äôs first business e-lending investment in Europe.

How we are achieving the mission? Using the latest Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies we built an intelligent tool with two main functionalities: 

Puts all the apps, systems and enterprise software used in a single organization into only one place (one window). This simplifies the activities execution, saves time and also resources, not only for the company, but for us as workforce. 

Identifies and analyzes the most repetitive processes inside the different business' areas and optimize them through automation build-up logic.

Hala works as your own digital assistant or clone. What do we mean by that? Well, interacting with Hala is as simple as speaking with your colleague, for executing any kind of process, simple or complex, you just need to ask through text messages, command buttons or voice. 

It's like having your personalized search engine where you can find any data from your company in just a few seconds or even better, like speaking to your phone, you just need to say few words and Hala will execute anything in a fast and precise way.

How we are planning to be the best of ourselves? The second part of our solution allows anyone to build their own process automation or as we call it ""create their own Digital Skill"". Inside Hala Platform we developed a simpler logic where you can build any automation, like constructing LEGO blocks, you don't need to be an expert in coding.

Hang on! We are not finished yet, after building your own Digital Skill, you can share it to everyone who might find a use of it, you just need to publish it in our Skills Store, for anyone to download and integrate to their daily-use enterprise software.

Let's revolutionize the way we work!

Professional-to-Business and Professional-to-Professional Interactions, Without The
Need For Intermediaries
Nowadays, professionals have completely lost control of their data. Furthermore the
prevailing system is not good for businesses either because they make investments
without being sure of having a return on investment. The current model makes it almost
impossible to gain access to highly qualified professionals and on top of that, the
success rate is rather low.
On Profede‚Äôs Platform we give the power back to the user. Professionals control their
profile, decide who has access to their data and are paid each time businesses or other
professionals use their data for any purpose. Thanks to blockchain, we are creating a
decentralized protocol that allows professionals to easily store and manage their
profiles, that are accessible by third parties.
Thanks to blockchain, professionals will be able to easily move their profiles and data
through the networks partaking in this protocol, in a private and safe manner. At the
same time, businesses and other professionals will have access to the profiles of the
professionals, with a guarantee of their legitimacy and certification of their reputation,
since all the content will be documented.
Profede‚Äôs Professional Protocol will allow businesses to make appropriate payments
for a professional's data regardless of the organization in which that person's
information is located. Intermediaries are eliminated and interactions are facilitated by
the network itself. Instead of paying any intermediaries, businesses automatically make
customized offers directly to professionals based on their reputation and profiles

Account-based marketing is a growing category in B2B marketing world. What we've done at #FlipMyFunnel is taken the traditional lead-based marketing funnel and flipped it over. Instead of pouring your money into lead generation you focus on key accounts and reach the necessary decision makers on their terms. Here are the four steps in our #FlipMyFunnel model:

1. Identify ‚Äì First, we need to find our best-fit customers. There are plenty of amazing technologies out there today that easily allow us to identify a list of companies that fit our best-fit customer criteria. This list becomes our target list and accounts that we want to get our message in front of.

2. Expand: Expand your reach to people and influencers in our target list of companies. As an account-based marketer, you are responsible for targeting influencers within the accounts you would like to reach. 

3. Engage: Engage your target decision makers with the right content on the right channel. There are many ways to get your message in front of your target audience such as; mobile, social, video, and display. This step is by far the broadest since there are so many ways to engage your prospects. 

4. Advocate: Turning your customers into fans is one of the most underutilized strategies of all time in today‚Äôs marketing, despite the fact that retaining current customers is far cheaper than bringing in new ones. Your existing customer base is the greatest opportunity to drive demand and buzz around your products.

We believe that the new BtoC (Business to consumer) startup world and its potential cannot be investigated by well-dressed investment bankers as it used to be in the traditional VC world, but rather only the real world can determine start ups' potential and success.

Krypton specializes in smart investments in BtoC PC - Business to consumer - personal computer products.
The sole purpose of the fund is to quickly launch the startup to the outside world without wasting precious time and capital on unproven and costly due diligence processes. 
Like many funds we use our capital to help startups finance and build a healthy profitable business in the long run.

What sets us apart from many funds is that Krypton, due its ownership structure, controls over one percent of the global internet marketing traffic, an immeasurable value, when startups join our fund

As part of our unique investment mechanism, we added a special phase called: ""The Mass Intelligence stage"", during which, we expose the start up to our huge traffic base letting the real world determine its strengths and weaknesses. 
If at the end of the Mass Intelligence stage our fund sees a multimillion dollar potential in the startup we use our predetermined right for equity.
On the other hand, if the real world determines there is no place for the start up in the current market we do not take any equity for the ""Mass Intelligence"" stage investment and both sides continue onward separately.

Tomindu (‚Äútransparency‚Äù in Chinese) is a high tech company operating in the field of logistics providing unprecedented innovative services to the importers, while maintaining full neutrality with freight forwarders. 
We genuinely believe that in 2017 any importer should be able to receive a quote, open an order, track existing shipments, and manage the accompanying paperwork all in one a place and with a few clicks. 
The need for reliable and timely information, the technological advances, and the desire to contribute to creating a more vibrant and flexible economic environment, are what drove us to invest in human capital and technological innovation. 

Tomindu and the East

Tomindu started out as an attempt to solve one of the most frustrating problems in the world of logistics ‚Äì constantly updated rates on shipments from the East.

When it comes to sea imports, the standard practice for the freight forwarders is to charge their customers whatever they quoted them upon request, knowing that the actual price they - the  freight forwarders - in turn will have to pay to the shipping lines can and most probably will decrease dramatically before the date of departure. (*for the most part a valid quote can only go down)

Tomindu's algorigthm is based on one thing ‚Äì transparency. We update the customers on the latest import prices, even after the initial quote was received and approved, and bill the customers according to the date of the voyage, saving tens of percent on every shipment. Only our partner freight forwarders offer this level transparency. 

Partners
Our global partnership has expanded to include freight forwarders and shipping lines, international agents, and consolidation agents in Israel, providing Tomindu with world-class coverage, and of course bridging the gap between the importers and their service providers.",Privately Held,,2-10 employees,"Shipping, Logistics, and Freight Forwarding, Online Freight Quotation",0,,,,"Logistics, , Shipping, Transportation",B2B

While the Southeast remains our primary focus, our highly regarded engineering skill and knowledge have enabled us to provide services to clients from Puerto Rico to Alaska. Our staff includes engineers, registered roof consultants, registered roof observers, roof system technicians and non-destructive testing technicians. 

""Good design can be accomplished only through detailed analysis. We are firm believers that you cannot understand how something works until you understand why it fails. Our extensive background in conducting failure investigations of existing systems gives us this level of understanding."" -Stuart W. Sutton, President
